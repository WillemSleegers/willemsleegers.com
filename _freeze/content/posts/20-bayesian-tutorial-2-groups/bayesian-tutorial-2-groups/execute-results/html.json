With the variables standardized, $\\sigma$ is limited to range from 0 to 1. If the predictor explains all the variance of the outcome variable, the residuals will be 0, meaning $\\sigma$ will be 0. If the predictor explains no variance, $\\sigma$ is equal to 1 because it will be similar to the standard deviation of the outcome variable, which is 1 because we've standardized it. Interestingly, this also means that the prior for $\\sigma$ is now dependent on the prior for the slope, because the slope is what determines how much variance is explained in the outcome variable. So let's think about the prior for the slope.\n\nThe prior for the slope is a bit easier now. We can specify a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5, together with a lower bound of -1 and upper bound of 1. With a standard deviation of 0.5, we cover a large range of possible slopes, but assign more plausibility to smaller correlations and less plausibility to very high correlations (like 1 and -1).\n\nAs for $\\sigma$, let's keep it simple and use a uniform prior that assign equal plausibility to each value between 0 and 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_height_male <- brm(\n  height ~ 0 + male + female,  \n  data = data, \n  family = gaussian,\n  sample_prior = TRUE,\n  cores = 4,\n  seed = 4,\n  file = \"models/model_height_.rds\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nCompiling Stan program...\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nStart sampling\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_height_male\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: height ~ 0 + male + female \n   Data: data (Number of observations: 352) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n       Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nmale     160.36      0.44   159.52   161.21 1.00     4026     3182\nfemale   149.51      0.41   148.70   150.29 1.00     4516     2994\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     5.56      0.21     5.16     6.00 1.00     4746     2892\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).
