In this post I discuss my arguments for why I think wild animal suffering is one of the most importance cause areas to work on.

Good introductions and summaries of the topic: https://longtermrisk.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/

An important reason for why I am interested in the suffering of wild animals is because it is a neglected problem. Worse, it's neglected because it's not even seen as a problem by many. It seems particularly sad that there is immense suffering taking place but rather than us feeling bad about it, we actively ignore it, or even relish it. It's like going back in history and thinking that having slaves is actually a good thing. In other words, I think the current situation regarding wild animal suffering can best be described as a tragedy.
