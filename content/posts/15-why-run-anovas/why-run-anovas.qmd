title: Why run ANOVAs?
description: "I often see researchers analyze group differences by first running an ANOVA and then looking at contrasts. Given that the interest is in the group differences, I don't understand why we don't run those contrasts right from the start."

In the field of social psychology I often see researchers analyze group differences by first running an ANOVA and then following up the ANOVA with contrast analyses to inspect specific group differences.

```{r}
#| message: false

# Load packages
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)

# Set the default ggplot theme
theme_set(theme_minimal())

# Set options
options(
  knitr.kable.NA = "",
  digits = 2
)
```

## The data

Say we ran a study with five different conditions. I'll simulate some data below so we have something concrete to think about.

```{r}
#| label: setting

# Set the simulation parameters
Ms <- c(0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.2)
SDs <- 1
n <- 195

# Produce the variance-covariance matrix
Sigma <- matrix(nrow = 5, ncol = 5, data = c(
    SDs, 0, 0, 0, 0,
    0, SDs, 0, 0, 0,
    0, 0, SDs, 0, 0,
    0, 0, 0, SDs, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 0, SDs
  )
)

# Simulate the values
m <- mvrnorm(n = n, mu = Ms, Sigma = Sigma, empirical = TRUE)

# Prepare the data by converting it to a data frame and making it tidy
colnames(m) <- c("group1", "group2", "group3", "group4", "group5")

data <- as_tibble(m)

data <- pivot_longer(
  data = data, 
  cols = everything(), 
  names_to = "condition", 
  values_to = "DV"
)

# Plot the simulated data
ggplot(data, aes(x = condition, y = DV)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .2, alpha = .25) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", geom = "pointrange") +
  labs(x = "Condition")
```

## The goals

With this kind of data I can imagine at least two different goals that a researcher may have. You could have a clear a priori prediction of which groups differ or you can go on a fishing expedition and simply see which conditions differ from each other.

It looks like that worked out, so now let's analyze the data.

```{r}
anova <- aov(DV ~ condition, data = data)
summary(anova)

lm <- lm(DV ~ condition, data = data)
summary(lm)

pairwise.t.test(data$DV, data$condition)

library(emmeans)
emmeans <- emmeans(lm, specs = pairwise ~ condition)
emmeans
```
