In my previous [blog
post](../../../blog/18-bayesian-tutorial-simple-regression/), I showed
how to use brms and tidybayes to run a simple regression, i.e., a
regression with a single predictor. This analysis required us to set
three priors: an intercept prior, a sigma prior, and a slope prior. We
can simplify this analysis by turning it into a correlational analysis.
This will remove the intercept prior and lets us think about the prior
for the slope as a standardized effect size, i.e., the correlation.

To run a correlational analysis we’ll need to standardize the outcome
and predictor variable, so in the code below I run the setup code as
usual and also standardize both variables that we’ll be correlating.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(brms)
library(tidybayes)
library(modelr)

theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 16))
primary <- "#16a34a"
secondary <- "#A3166F"

options(
  mc.cores = 4,
  brms.threads = 4,
  brms.backend = "cmdstanr",
  brms.file_refit = "on_change"
)

data <- read_csv("Howell1.csv")
data <- data |>
  filter(age >= 18) |>
  mutate(
    height_z  = (height - mean(height)) / sd(height),
    weight_z  = (weight - mean(weight)) / sd(weight)
  )
```

</details>

The formula for our model is slightly different compared to the formula
of the previous single-predictor model and that’s because we can omit
the intercept. By standardizing both the outcome and predictor
variables, the intercept is guarenteed to be 0. The regression line
always passes through the mean of the predictor and outcome variable.
The mean of both is 0 because of the standardization and the intercept
is the value the outcome takes when the predictor is 0. We could still
include a prior for the intercept and set it to 0 (using `constant(0)`)
but we can also simply tell brms not to estimate it. The formula syntax
then becomes: `height_z ~ 0 + weight_z`.

Let’s confirm that this means we only need to set two priors.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
get_prior(height_z ~ 0 + weight_z, data = data)
```

</details>

| prior                | class | coef     | group | resp | dpar | nlpar | lb  | ub  | source  |
|:---------------------|:------|:---------|:------|:-----|:-----|:------|:----|:----|:--------|
|                      | b     |          |       |      |      |       |     |     | default |
|                      | b     | weight_z |       |      |      |       |     |     | default |
| student_t(3, 0, 2.5) | sigma |          |       |      |      |       | 0   |     | default |

Indeed, we’re left with a prior for <math>$\sigma$</math> and one for
`weight_z`, which we can specify either via class `b` or the specific
coefficient for `weight_z`.

Let’s also write down our model more explicitly, which is the same as
the single predictor regression but without the intercept
(<math>$\alpha$</math>). $$
heights_i ∼ Normal(\mu_i, \sigma)\\\\\mu_i = \beta x_i
$$

## Setting the priors

Let’s start with the prior for the slope (<math>$\beta$</math>). A
correlation takes a value that ranges from -1 to 1. If you know
absolutely nothing about what kind of correlation to expect, you could
set a uniform prior that assign equal probability to every value from -1
to -1. Alternatively, we could use a prior that describes a belief that
no correlation is most likely, but with some probability that higher
correlations are possible too. This could be done with a normal
distribution centered around 0. In the case of this particular model, in
which height is regressed onto weight, we can probably expect a sizeable
positive correlation. So let’s use a skewed normal distribution that
puts most of the probability on a positive correlation but is wide
enough to allow for a range of correlations, including a negative one.
brms has the `skew_normal()` function to specify a prior that’s a skewed
normal distribution. I fiddled around with the numbers a bit and the
distribution below is sort of what makes sense to me.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
prior <- tibble(r = seq(-1, 1, .01)) |>
  mutate(
    prob = dskew_normal(r, xi = .7, omega = .4, alpha = -3)
  )

ggplot(prior, aes(x = r, y = prob)) +
  geom_line(color = primary) +
  labs(x = "Slope", y = "")
```

</details>

![](../../../public/figures/19-bayesian-tutorial-correlations/slope-prior-1.svg)

What should the prior for <math>$\sigma$</math> be? With the variables
standardized, <math>$\sigma$</math> is limited to range from 0 to 1. If
the predictor explains all the variance of the outcome variable, the
residuals will be 0, meaning <math>$\sigma$</math> will be 0. If the
predictor explains no variance, <math>$\sigma$</math> is equal to 1
because it will be similar to the standard deviation of the outcome
variable, which is 1 because we’ve standardized it. Interestingly, this
also means that the prior for <math>$\sigma$</math> is completely
dependent on the prior for the slope, because the slope is what
determines how much variance is explained in the outcome variable. I
don’t know exactly how to deal with this dependency, except to fear it
and make sure to carefully inspect the output so that we don’t have any
problems due to incompatible priors. One way to avoid it entirely is to
use a uniform prior that assign equal plausibility to each value between
0 and 1, so let’s do that.

## Running the model

With the priors ready, we can run the model.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
model <- brm(
  height_z ~ 0 + weight_z,
  data = data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = c(
    prior(uniform(0, 1), class = "sigma", ub = 1),
    prior(
      skew_normal(.7, .4, -3),
      class = "b", lb = -1, ub = 1
    )
  ),
  sample_prior = TRUE,
  seed = 4,
  file = "models/model.rds"
)

model
```

</details>

     Family: gaussian 
      Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity 
    Formula: height_z ~ 0 + weight_z 
       Data: data (Number of observations: 352) 
      Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;
             total post-warmup draws = 4000

    Regression Coefficients:
             Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS
    weight_z     0.74      0.03     0.68     0.81 1.00     3242     2432

    Further Distributional Parameters:
          Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS
    sigma     0.66      0.03     0.61     0.71 1.00     3189     2683

    Draws were sampled using sample(hmc). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
    and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
    scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).

The output shows that the estimate for the slope, i.e., the correlation,
is 0.74. This is just one number though. Let’s visualize the entire
distribution, including the prior.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
draws <- model |>
  gather_draws(prior_b, b_weight_z) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(
    distribution = if_else(
      str_detect(.variable, "prior"), "prior", "posterior"
    ),
    distribution = fct_relevel(distribution, "prior")
  )

ggplot(draws, aes(x = .value, fill = distribution)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, position = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Correlation", y = "", fill = "Distribution") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(secondary, primary))
```

</details>

![](../../../public/figures/19-bayesian-tutorial-correlations/correlation-1.svg)

It looks like we can update towards a higher correlation and also be
more certain about it because the range of the posterior is much
narrower than that of our prior.

What about sigma? We saw that the correlation between the predictor and
outcome is 0.74. Squaring this number gives us the amount of variance
explained (0.55), so if we subtract this from 1 we’re left with the
variance that is unexplained (0.45). Squaring this number to bring it
back to a standard deviation gives us 0.67, which matches the estimate
for sigma that we saw in the output of brms.

## Using a regularizing prior

In the previous section we used a personal and hopefully informed prior,
at least to some degree. What would happen if we instead used a [generic
weakly informative
prior](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations)?
This is a prior centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
prior <- tibble(r = seq(-3, 3, .01)) |>
  mutate(prob = dnorm(r, mean = 0, sd = 1))

ggplot(prior, aes(x = r, y = prob)) +
  geom_line(color = primary) +
  labs(x = "Slope", y = "")
```

</details>

![](../../../public/figures/19-bayesian-tutorial-correlations/weakly-informative-slope-prior-1.svg)

It’s a very broad prior and centered at 0. Does it being centered around
0 push the final estimate closer to a null effect? Let’s see by running
the model.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
model_generic_prior <- brm(
  height_z ~ 0 + weight_z,

    prior(normal(0, 1), class = "b", lb = -1, ub = 1)

    Draws were sampled using sample(hmc). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
    and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
    scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).

<details class="code-fold">

  mutate(
    distribution = if_else(
      str_detect(.variable, "prior"),
      "prior", "posterior"
    ),
    distribution = fct_relevel(distribution, "prior")
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = .value, fill = distribution)) +

The previous estimate of the correlation was 0.74 and now it’s 0.75.
Apparently the prior did not influence the final estimate. This
hopefully alleviates some worries about priors always having a strong
impact on the final results and it also shows you don’t always need to
carefully construct a prior. Of course, in certain cases the prior will
have a strong influence, for example when the prior is very strong or
when there isn’t much data. The prior we used here was broad enough so
it didn’t exert a strong influence on the final estimates.

## Multiple correlations

What if you want to test multiple correlations? There are two ways to do
this, as far as I know. The first is to simply run separate models, each
testing a single correlation. The second is by creating a model that
tests multiple correlations at once.

### One-by-one solution

Running multiple models to test each correlation is a bit of a chore,
but it’s made easier with the `update()` function in brms, which makes
it so that you don’t have to write as much code. In the code below I
standardize `age` in addition to the two columns we already standardized
and run three models in total, correlating `height` with `weight`,
`height` with `age`, and `age` with `weight`. I’ll use the same generic
prior from the last model and repeat the full code for that model,
followed by two updates.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
data <- mutate(data, age_z = (age - mean(age)) / sd(age))

r_height_weight <- brm(
  height_z ~ 0 + weight_z,
  data = data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = c(
    prior(uniform(0, 1), class = "sigma", ub = 1),
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = "b", lb = -1, ub = 1)
  ),
  seed = 4,
  silent = 2,
  file = "models/r_height_weight.rds"
)

r_height_age <- update(
  r_height_weight,
  height_z ~ 0 + age_z,
  newdata = data,
  seed = 4,
  silent = 2,
  control = list(adapt_delta = .9),
  file = "models/r_height_age.rds"
)

r_weight_age <- update(
  r_height_weight,
  weight_z ~ 0 + age_z,
  newdata = data,
  seed = 4,
  silent = 2,
  control = list(adapt_delta = .9),
  file = "models/r_weight_age.rds"
)
```

</details>

Initially, the model correlating height with age produced a warning
about divergent transitions. brms produces a helpful warning message
with a link to more information about what exactly this means (in short,
it means the sampler thinks it’s off in estimating the posterior). The
message suggests we increase `adapt_delta` above 0.8, so I adjusted the
code to set `adapt_delta` to 0.9. Re-running the model got rid of the
warning messages.

The correlations are in the table below (the `Estimate` column).

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
bind_rows(
  as_tibble(fixef(r_height_weight)),
  as_tibble(fixef(r_height_age)),
  as_tibble(fixef(r_weight_age))
) |>
  mutate(
    Pair = c("height - weight", "height - age", "weight - age"),
    .before = Estimate
  )
```

</details>

| Pair            |   Estimate | Est.Error |       Q2.5 |      Q97.5 |
|:----------------|-----------:|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| height - weight |  0.7545178 | 0.0353659 |  0.6869373 |  0.8250272 |

```

### Simultaneous solution

The simultaneous solution is trickier but thankfully there’s a very
helpful [blog
post](https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/blog/2019-02-16-bayesian-correlations-let-s-talk-options/)
by Solomon Kurz to explain it, so I’ll mostly just focus on running the
code here and showing the result.

Initially this approach put me off because I did not understand the
prior, but then I realized we could simply sample the prior as well and
visualize it to show what the prior looks like.

Modelling multiple correlations at once requires specifying the formula
using multivariate syntax. You can take a look at the code below to see
what this syntax looks like. Additionally, we need to append
`set_rescor(TRUE)` to the formula to tell brms to calculate residual
correlations, which will actually be the correlations we’re interested
in.

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` r
model <- brm(
  formula = bf(
    mvbind(height_z, weight_z, age_z) ~ 0,
    sigma ~ 0
  ) + set_rescor(TRUE),
  data = data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = prior(lkj(2), class = rescor),
  sample_prior = TRUE,
  seed = 4,
  silent = 2,
  file = "models/multiple-correlations.rds"
)

    rescor(weightz,agez)        3153

    Draws were sampled using sample(hmc). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
    and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
    scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).

The model output shows the correlations in the Residual Correlations
section. You’ll see that the estimates match the ones we found when
running the correlations one-by-one. The 95% CIs also largely match,
with some small differences (for more comparisons, see the previously
linked blog post by Solomon Kurz).

Let’s also plot the posteriors, including their prior.

<details class="code-fold">

  mutate(
    .variable = case_match(
      .variable,
      "prior_rescor" ~ "prior",
      "rescor__heightz__weightz" ~ "height-weight",
      "rescor__heightz__agez" ~ "height-age",
      "rescor__weightz__agez" ~ "weight-age"
    ),
    .variable = fct_relevel(.variable, "prior")
  )

ggplot(draws, aes(x = .value)) +
  facet_wrap(~.variable, ncol = 2) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = primary) +
  labs(x = "Correlation", y = "")
```

</details>

![](../../../public/figures/19-bayesian-tutorial-correlations/simultaneous-correlations-plot-1.svg)

It looks like we used a relatively wide prior centered around 0. That’s
good to know because I had no idea what the `lkj()` prior was doing.
Other than that the results look similar to what we found previously.

## Summary

Running a correlation in brms is the same as running a simple
regression, except that the outcome and predictor are standardized.
Because of the standardization, the intercept can be omitted, thus
simplifying the model. The priors are also easier to set as the
correlation must range from -1 to and 1 and sigma from 0 to 1. You can
also run multiple correlations by running separate models or by
modelling them all at once using brms’ multivariate syntax.
