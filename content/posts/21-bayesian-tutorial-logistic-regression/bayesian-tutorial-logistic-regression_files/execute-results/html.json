Logistic regression is different from the models from previous posts because it involves a dichotomous outcome measure. This is different from modeling means, which we have roughly been doing, so there are some new things to keep in mind here.\n\nRun the following code to get started.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\n\ndata <- read_csv(\"Howell1.csv\")\n\ntheme_set(theme_minimal())\n\ncolors <- c(\"#93CFDB\", \"#1E466E\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's say that we want to model the proportion of males and females in our data. We can do that by running a logistic regression in which we regress the outcome (male/female) on an intercept and specify that the outcome comes from a binomial family and that the . We use the `get_prior()` function to get a first grasp of which priors we need.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_prior(male ~ 1, data = data, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|prior                |class     |coef |group |resp |dpar |nlpar |lb |ub |source  |\n|:--------------------|:---------|:----|:-----|:----|:----|:-----|:--|:--|:-------|\n|student_t(3, 0, 2.5) |Intercept |     |      |     |     |      |   |   |default |\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe only need a single prior for the intercept. That's easy enough, but the family and link argument are kinda new. \n\n$$\\displaylines{males_i âˆ¼ Binomial(n, p_i) \\\\ logit(p_i) = \\alpha + \\beta x_i}$$\n\n## Setting the priors\n\nYou might think that because we're modelling a proportion, the prior for the intercept should be a distribution of values constrained to range from 0 to 1. This is not the case because of the logit transformation. The logit link transforms the probability scale onto a linear scale that ranges from minus infinity to infinity, although the bulk of the values are around 0. We can show this in a graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- tibble(\n  x = seq(0, 1, 0.001),\n  logit = logit_scaled(x)\n)\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = logit)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"p\", y = \"logit(p)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Transformation of probability values via the logit link](bayesian-tutorial-logistic-regression_files/figure-html/logit-link-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur prior needs to be set on the transformed values, not the original probability scale. brms sets a default prior of `student_t(3, 0, 2.5)`. Let's take a look at what this looks like by running a model and sampling only from this prior.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit_prior_default <- brm(\n  male ~ 1,\n  family = binomial(link = \"logit\"),\n  data = data,\n  file = \"model-prior-default.rds\", \n  sample_prior = \"only\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe get a warning that using the Bernoulli family might be more efficient because we only have 2 levels and that we need to specify the number of trials when using the Binomial family; let's keep this in mind when we run the code again. For now, let's plot the prior.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndraws_prior <- as_draws_df(fit_prior_default)\ndraws_prior_inv <- mutate(\n  draws_prior, \n  b_Intercept = inv_logit_scaled(b_Intercept)\n)\n  \nggplot(draws_prior, aes(x = b_Intercept)) + \n  geom_histogram()\nggplot(draws_prior_inv, aes(x = b_Intercept)) + \n  geom_histogram()  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Logit scale](bayesian-tutorial-logistic-regression_files/figure-html/default-prior-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Probability scale](bayesian-tutorial-logistic-regression_files/figure-html/default-prior-plot-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\nDefault brms prior on the intercept in a logistic regression\n:::",
