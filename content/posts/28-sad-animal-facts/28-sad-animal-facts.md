This post serves to illustrate why I agree with the quote above from
Thomas Huxley. Below I list examples of what happens in nature that I
think are just horrible and that I wish we could do something about.

The list is not complete and I intend to continuously update it when I
encounter more sad facts.

## Mammals

- [Eastern meadow
  vole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_meadow_vole) (Microtus
  pennsylvanicus)

  - One study found that only 12% of meadow voles survive the first
    month, with most voles likely dying due to predation ([Getz,
    1960](https://doi.org/10.2307/2422671)).

- [Bornean orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bornean_orangutan)
  (Pongo pygmaeus)

  - Male orangutans frequently force female orangutans to mate with them
    ([Mitani, 1985](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-3472(85)80063-4)).

- [Meerkat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meerkat) (Suricata suricatta)

  - Dominant females commonly kill pups born to subordinates and
    temporarily expel subordinate females from the group during the
    latter months of their own pregnancy ([Clutton-Brock et al.,
    1998](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1998.0573)).

- [Bottlenose
  dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin)
  (Tursiops truncatus)

  - Bottlenose dolphins have been found to kill harbor porpoises,
    plausibly to practice their infanticide skills or to maintain their
    fighting skills ([Cotter et al.,
    2012](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2011.00474.x)).

- [Chimpanzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee) (Pan
  troglodytes)

  - Intergroup aggression, including lethal attacks, is a pervasive
    feature of chimpanzee societies ([Wilson & Wrangham,
    2003](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.061002.120046)).

  - Both male and female chimpanzees kill infants ([Townsend et al.,
    2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.03.020)).

- [Northern short-tailed
  shrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_short-tailed_shrew)
  (Blarina brevicauda)

  - The Northern short-tailed shrew has venomous saliva that it uses to
    immobilize some of its prey to eat it later ([Martin,
    1981](https://doi.org/10.2307/1380494)).

## Birds

- [Brown-headed
  cowbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_cowbird)
  (Molothrus ater)

  - Cowbirds lay their eggs in the nests of other birds and display
    ‘mafia’ like behavior by destroying eggs or nestlings of hosts if
    they eject their eggs ([Hoover & Robinson,
    2007](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0609710104)).

- [Common cuckoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cuckoo) (Cuculus
  canorus)

  - The common cuckoo female lays one egg is the nest of other birds and
    usually removes and eats one of the host’s eggs. In general, the
    cuckoo egg hatches before those of the host and the cuckoo chicks
    start evicting host offspring from the nest ([Martín-Gálvez et al.,
    2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.03.031)).

- [Mallard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard) (Anas platyrhynchos)

  - Mallards forcibly mate with females ([McKinney & Evarts,
    1998](https://doi.org/10.2307/40166723)).

- [Kelp gull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp_gull) (Larus
  dominicanus)

  - In Namibia, kelp gull pluck out the eyes of juvenile Cape fur seals
    and then later feast on its carcass ([Gallagher et al.,
    2015](https://doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2015.1071718)).

## Insects

- [Forelius pusillus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forelius_pusillus)
  (Forelius pusillus)

  - In the Brazilian ant Forelius pusillus, the nest entrance is closed
    at sunset. One to eight workers ﬁnish the job from the outside and,
    in doing so, sacriﬁce their lives ([Tofilski et al.,
    2008](https://doi.org/10.1086/591688)).

## Arachnids

- [Desert spider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegodyphus_lineatus)
  (Stegodyphus lineatus)

  - The offspring of the desert spider eat their own mother ([Salomon et
    al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1636/B14-15.1)).

## Fish

- [Sand tiger shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_tiger_shark)
  (Carcharias taurus)

  - During their pregnancy, the most developed embryo will feed on its
    siblings ([Gilmore et al.,
    1983](https://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf-content/1983/812/gilmore.pdf)).
