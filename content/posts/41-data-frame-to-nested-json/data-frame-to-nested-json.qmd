In this blog post I cover a quick way to convert a data frame to a nested JSON object. Run the code below to follow along.

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
```

Take the following simple data frame:

```{r}
data <- tibble(
  name = "Dad",
  age = 40,
  child = c("Son", "Daughter")
)

data_nested <- nest(data, children = c(child))

toJSON(data_nested, pretty = TRUE)
```
