In this blog post I cover a quick way to convert a data frame to a nested JSON object. Run the code below to follow along.

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
```

Take the following simple data frame:

```{r}
trainer <- tibble(
  trainer = "Ash",
  age = 10,
)

home_town <- tibble(
  trainer = "Ash",
  town = "Pallet Town",
  population = 8
)

pokemon <- tibble(
  trainer = "Ash",
  pokemon = c("Bulbasaur", "Squirtle", "Charmander"),
  type = c("Grass", "Water", "Fire")
)

data <- full_join(trainer, home_town)
data <- full_join(data, pokemon)

data

data |>
  mutate(home_town = tibble(town, population)) |>
  select(-town, -population) |>
  nest(pokemon = c(pokemon, type)) |>
  toJSON(pretty = TRUE)
```
