```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

## Create a new column with a value from a specific cell

Take the following simple data frame:

```{r}
#| label: data-column-with-cell-value
df <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
  "A", 0.1,
  "B", 0.4,
  "C", 0.2,
  "D", 0.3,
  "E", 0.5
)

df
```

Using the following code, we can add a new column that repeats a specific value from column `y` based on a value in a column `x`.

```{r}
#| label: snippet-column-with-cell-value
df <- mutate(df, z = nth(y, which(x == "B")))
df
```

This can be useful if you want to do scaling based on specific values.

```{r}
#| label: usecase-column-with-cell-value
df |>
  mutate(y_scaled = y / z)
```
