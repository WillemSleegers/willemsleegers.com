<p>Together with <a href="https://mbnuijten.com">Michèle Nuijten</a> I am working on a <code>statcheck</code> implementation for Microsoft Word.</p>
<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/statcheck/index.html"><code>statcheck</code></a> is an R package designed to catch statistical reporting mistakes. It works by first extracting statistics from a paper (e.g., <em>t</em> values, degrees of freedom, <em>p</em>-values). It will then use the test statistic and degrees of freedom to re-calculate the <em>p</em>-value and compare it to the reported <em>p</em>-value. If the two don’t match, there is a reporting mistake.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>statcheck</code> package in R to check your paper or you can use the <a href="http://statcheck.io">web app</a>. Using the web app consists of simply uploading your paper and checking the results. You can then go back to the paper and correct the mistakes.</p>
<p>Of course, an even easier way is to have <code>statcheck</code> available while writing your paper. That’s why Michèle and I are working on a Word add-in that allows you to check potential reporting mistakes as you’re working on it.</p>
<p>Our current progress can be found on our Github page <a href="https://github.com/WillemSleegers/statcheck-word">here</a>, and I will update this page with more information as we continue to develop the add-in.</p>
