    "text": "Why is this important?\n\n“It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps, the faculty for discourse?…the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\n\nThis (partial) quote by Jeremy Bentham gets to the heart of the matter. Whether something deserves moral concern is predominantly (if not only) a function of whether that something is capable of suffering. Cheating on a partner is bad not because cheating is inherently bad, but because it likely causes great suffering on the cheated-on partner. If your partner doesn’t care about being cheated on (i.e., being in an open relationship), cheating is no longer a bad thing. This shows morality is about the consequences of one’s actions and whether those consequences cause suffering.\nMany animals can suffer. It is unclear and impossible with our current knowledge about consciousness to assess which animals are capable of suffering, but we know enough to confidently say that some animals can suffer. Large mammals such as cows, sheep, goats, and horses can undoubtedly suffer. Smaller creatures such as chicken and turkeys are similarly unlucky and likely also capable. It is less clear when it comes to fish, but I would put my money them being able to suffer rather than being experience-less creatures.\nThe examples of animals I used above are the kinds of animals we farm. These are the kinds of animals we treat in ways that cause them to suffer, with great intensity and in great numbers. Chicken, for example, live in crowded spaces that cause in-fighting, the spread of diseases, and deaths due to, for instance, pile ups. They are artificially selected to grow at unhealthily fast rates, causing physical abnormalities. They are prevented from displaying their instinctive behaviors, such as establishing pecking orders, dust bathing, building nests, and spreading their wings. Sometimes farmers address these problems, although not always in the animal’s best interest. Injuries due to in-fighting is reduced by cutting or burning off the beaks, thus preventing them from harming each other. Other farm animals face similar situations.\nWhat makes it worse is the scale of factory farming. In the Netherlands alone, over 600 million land animals were killed in 2019. And that’s just in the Netherlands, a pretty tiny country. In the U.S., 9.76 billion land animals were killed in 2020. These numbers are so big they almost lose their meaning. The reality is, however, that factory farming causing suffering in billions and billions of individual animals, every year.\nPeople might retort that killing animals for food is simply the natural order of things. This argument is easy to refute: The natural order also sucks. We should not look at nature to determine what is good or bad (this is called the naturalistic fallacy). In nature, all kinds of suffering takes place. Animals (including humans) die due to various causes including disease, disasters, predation, starvation, and so on. These things are normal in nature. As humans, we have done our best to remove all these natural threats from our lives because that reduces our suffering. If we want to be natural, we should invite all these threats back into our lives. Of course, that’s not what we want to do, because we don’t want to suffer.\nI think we should extent that courtesy also to wild animals. We have succeeded in making our lives a lot better, while ignoring the same problems in other species. If we care about the lives of conscious creatures (such as our fellow humans, our pets, our zoo animals), we should also care about the lives of wild animals.\nIn short, farm animals suffer in horrible ways in great numbers, and the same happens in nature (although perhaps less efficiently than in factory farms). Given that suffering is the main reason to care about something, this logically means that we should figure out ways to alleviate their suffering. I hope to contribute to this."

Eventually I also hope to use these platforms to share my own work.\nI’ve joined a project by Mercy for Animals on a multi-country survey to develop insights on people’s knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions and behaviors regarding farmed animal issues and key advocacy activities.\nI’ve started my own project that is a meta-analysis on meat intervention studies. There have been several meta-analyses on this topic (see here for a recent one), but I think I can contribute in some unique ways by creating a ‘live meta-analysis’ that can continuously be updated with new studies."

This is likely due to the fact that researchers do not have the necessary software tools to reliably take the output of statistics from their data analysis software and enter it into their text editor. Instead, researchers are likely to copy statistics from the output by hand or by copy-pasting the output. Both techniques are error-prone, resulting in many papers containing statistical typos. This is a problem because statistical output is used in meta-analyses to aggregate the evidence for particular theories, which sometimes also inform policy. In some cases, the errors may even be so large that it affects the conclusion drawn from the statistical test."

    "text": "What am I working on?\nAdmittedly, I am simply joining Michèle and her efforts to help researchers make fewer typos. She and her colleagues have already done a lot of the work—we’re now just trying to make it even better. For example, Sacha Epskamp and Michèle developed statcheck. statcheck is an R package designed to catch statistical reporting mistakes. It works by first extracting statistics from a paper (e.g., t values, degrees of freedom, p-values). It then uses the test statistic and degrees of freedom to re-calculate the p-value and compare it to the reported p-value. If the two don’t match, there is probably a reporting mistake.\nYou can use the statcheck package in R to check your paper or you can use the web app. Using the web app consists of simply uploading your paper and checking the results. You can then go back to the paper and correct the mistakes.\nWith my experience creating tidystats, and particularly the tidystats Word add-in, we’ve started to create a Word add-in for statcheck. This add-in allows researchers to scan their document for statistical inconsistencies, find them, and fix them. This add-in is currently in beta and we hope to release it soon.\nWe are also working on improving statcheck together with the eScience Center. Together with their help we hope to expand statcheck so it can catch a greater variety of statistical inconsistencies. We have had some preparatory meetings with them and plan to fully begin this project soon."

In some cases, the errors may even be so large that it affects the conclusion drawn from the statistical test.\nThere is also a more fundamental issue. Researchers usually only report the statistics in their manuscript and nowhere else. As a result, researchers face trade-offs between reporting all statistics, writing a legible text, and journal guidelines. Reporting all statistics makes results sections difficult (and boring) to read and it also takes up valuable space. Consequently, researchers are likely to only report the statistics that they deem to be relevant, rather than reporting all the statistics. While this is fine for someone who wants to simply read the paper and get the main takeaway, this is not desirable from a cumulative science perspective. All statistics should be easily available so they can be build on in future research."

    "text": "What am I working on?\nI have designed an R package called tidystats that enables researchers to export the statistics from their analyses into a single file. It works by adding your analyses to a list (in R) and then exporting this list to a JSON file. This file will contain all the statistics from the analyses, in an organized format, ready to be used in other software.\nBy storing the output of statistical tests into a separate file, rather than only in one’s manuscript, the researcher no longer needs to worry about which analyses to report in the space-limited manuscript. They can simply share the file together with the manuscript, on OSF or as supplemental material.\nAn additional benefit is that because JSON files are easy to read for computers, it is (relatively) easy to write software that does cool things with these files.\nAn example of software that can read the JSON file is the tidystats Microsoft Word add-in. This add-in can be installed via the Add-in Store from inside Word. With this add-in, researchers can upload the JSON file to reveal a user-friendly list of their analyses. Clicking on an analysis reveals the associated statistics and clicking on a statistic inserts it into the document. This add-in also comes with several time-saving features, such as inserting multiple statistics at once (immediately in APA style) and automatic updating of statistics.\nRecently, I’ve also obtained a grant to work on tidystats. Thanks to this grant, the functionality of tidystats will be expanded, both in terms of adding support for more analyses and by expanding to other platforms, such as Python and Google Docs.\nBesides working on the software itself, I also spent some time on making it accessible. I have given talks introducing tidystats and I’ve created a website to help people become familiar with tidystats."

For example, cognitive dissonance theory has been used to explain religious beliefs, unhealthy behaviors, and people’s attitude towards animals.\nBefore the theory can be applied, however, it needs to be verified. We need to have sufficient evidence to believe in the theory. The social psychological evidence we have for the theory is, however, quite weak. The research stems from old research, mostly conducted in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. While this would not necessarily be a problem, it is a problem in the case of social psychology. The original studies were conducted with extremely low sample sizes and without pre-registration, or other tools that limit p-hacking. This means that many past findings may be false positives, which is supported by recent findings that show many findings in psychology do not replicate."

Many people contributed an answer, but many of them were of the type I feared. Most consisted of some statistical jargon that confuses me more, rather than less. Other responses were very useful, though, so I recommend checking out the replies to the tweet. In this post, I will try to describe my favorite way of looking at the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 5, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatistics\n\n\npower analysis\n\n\n\n\nA curious thing happened in the field of social psychology: Social psychologists finally realized that statistical power is important.
