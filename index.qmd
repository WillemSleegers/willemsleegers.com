## About

I'm a Senior Behavioral Scientist at [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/). I am part of the survey team, which means I conduct research on attitude assessments and attitude change, using surveys and experimental designs. Before joining Rethink Priorities, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Social Psychology at [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/). On this website you can find information about some of the projects I'm involved in. I also blog about various topics related to my work.

## CV

I'm an Senior Behavioral Scientist at Rethink Priorities. I have recently left academia after having built up 10 years of research experience, with publications of both scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, as well as software publications. It should be no surprise then that my skill set consists of research skills (e.g., experimental design, data analysis, writing) and technical skills (e.g., programming). I now look forward to applying my skills to topics of great impact together with my colleagues at Rethink Priorities.
