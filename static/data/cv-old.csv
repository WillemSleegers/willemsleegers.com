projects,tidystats,,"I created an R package called tidystats. tidystats can combine the output of statistical models and save them as a simple text file. Too often important statistical results cannot be retrieved from scientific papers, either due to errors in reporting or due to the great hassle of having to extract them from PDFs. tidystats can be used to easily and reliable report statistical results in a manuscript, as well as share them freely with others."
projects,Personal website,,"I have my own website at www.willemsleegers.com where I write about my research and offer tutorials on various topics related to my research, such how to prepare eye tracker data. These tutorials mostly consist of the statistical programming language R. The website itself is also created in R."
projects,Github,,"On my Github page I host several repositories of code that can be useful to fellow academics. This includes code on tidystats, a mouse-tracking implementation in oTree and item-analysis code of multiple-choice exams with R Markdown."
